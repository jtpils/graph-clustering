# Clustering techniques in graphs and application to point cloud data

In the following we compared two techniques of clustering Kmeans and spectral clustering. For spectral clustering we used the following reference:

We used the ...

In part I we used a generative model of graphs called mixed membership stochastic block model (MMSBM) from reference:

We show how kmeans and spectral clustering performs in this framework

In part II we used the previous methods of graph clustering to perform clustering on a point cloud data

We show how kmeans and spectral clustering performs in this framework

## Part I: mixed membership stochastic block model (MMSBM)

## Part II: Application to Point Cloud Data
